# learn_kube
Trying to learn Kubernetes CNCF landscape tools by doing. 

Thinking something like:  

1: start  
make easy python
make into docker image
push to dockerhub
get kubernetes for server and service with deployment on minikube

2: helm  
turn into helm chart to do things from 1

3: more k8s  
liveness, configmap, values, secrets, pod security policies

4: vault and secrets
* make vault  
* make secrets for mysql password in vault and make a service for vault 
* helm chart for vault  
// basically got all that to work, but manually. I don't really know how to manually get the info to config the vault auth from kubernetes from the vault image. Like it needs kubectl and vault CLI?  
// and even then, how does the python actually grab the stuff? I can use the consul thing to fill afile, but it would have to have a bunch of other stuff to get updated after TTL? 

4: get ready for dB  
secret stoage w/ vault and use (off cluster probably w/ exposed port) 

5: dB  
add a mysql dB (off cluster w/ docker and exposed port, just pretend) and have server talk to that, maybe use helm requirement for mysql and put onto cluster? 

6: native dB  
vitess

: storage
have python server write files and shit, 3x server share storage, PVC things?
